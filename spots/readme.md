# AJ4VD QRSS Spots

This page serves is a running log of notable QRSS spots. AJ4VD's QRSS signal is transmitted from Gainesville, Florida, USA.

I got OOK and FSK working together (the S shape in the middle). I'm also now using a cude oven, but am not sure yet how stable frequency is over long timespans.

I improved my amplifier (now output 500mW) and am impressed how well my attic dipole is doing! It runs east/west so it radiates north/south. I saw my signal on a few more grabbers.

AJ4VD spotted in Pensacola, FL (W4HBK) but this 8-hour grab reveals when my AC kicks on and off and demonstrates the necessity of ovenizing my setup. It's the signal around 10,139,980 Hz. | ![](/spots/2017-07-14/W4HBK-Pensacola-FL-USA-unstable.jpg)

This week I strung-up a 30m dipole in the attic and built an oscillator, keyer, and amplifier (all as separate modules). I finished the amplifier this morning and spotted the signal (the rectangular squiggle) on two grabbers. I was running 3 PPV into 50 Ohm so I think that's about 22 mW.
